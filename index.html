                    <p>In 1808 John Dalton developt the first atomic model. This improved the understanding of chemical reactions and other phanomenon which were earlier just viewed as that. Furthermore his model included four theorems about the atom from which three turned out to be true. Only the last one was later proven wrong. Those properties were</p>

                        <li>Every elements atom has exactly the same mass and volume</li>

                        <li>Atoms are the smallest particle(<em>wrong assumption</em>)</li>

                    <h3 class="thompson align">Thompsons Model</h3>
                    <p>Daltons assumption about general atomic properties kick started a tone of new development on this field. This led to Thompsons assumption of even smaller particles then the atom. He thought that some needed to be positively charged and others needed to have a negativ charge. He called those negativ particles <span>"Electron"</span>.</p>
                    <h4 class="align">Discovery of the electron and a new model</h4>
                    <p>Because of his earlier assumptions he created he new way to think about atoms, <span>The raisin cake model</span>. Daltons first three assumptions stilll applied to this model, but additionally he included electrons which were like raisins in a positively charged cake. Later he even proofed the existens of electrons and so the fourth property of Daltons model turned out to be false.</p>
