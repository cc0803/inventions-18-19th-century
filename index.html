                <p>In 1808 John Dalton developt the first atomic model. This improved the understanding of chemical reactions and other phanomenon which were earlier just viewed as that. Furthermore his model included four theorems about the atom from which three turned out to be true. Only the last one was later proven wrong. Those properties were</p>
